> _A calmer way to read Christian news—built for discernment, not outrage._

Today marks the launch of Kingdom Post, a new iPhone app designed for Christians who want to stay informed without being overwhelmed. In a media landscape shaped by speed, polarization, and endless commentary, Kingdom Post offers something different: a focused, thoughtful place to read Christian news from across the theological spectrum.

Kingdom Post brings together articles from trusted Christian publishers—Evangelical, Catholic, Reformed, Mainline, and Progressive—into one unified feed. Instead of forcing users to choose a side or live inside an echo chamber, the app quietly provides context, helping readers understand where an article is coming from while leaving judgment where it belongs: with the reader.

There are no comment sections. No outrage metrics. No push notifications demanding attention.

Just reading.

The app learns gently from how you read—what you finish, what you return to, what you skip—and over time curates a feed that reflects your interests without boxing you in. You'll still see thoughtful perspectives you may not always agree with, because growth often happens at the edges of comfort.

Kingdom Post is intentionally simple. Headlines are clean and readable. Articles open into an immersive, full-screen reading experience. Navigation is driven by natural gestures, so the interface fades away and the words take center stage.

Most importantly, Kingdom Post is free. There are no ads, no subscriptions, and no accounts to create. The app does not track you, profile you, or sell your data. Everything stays on your device.

At launch, Kingdom Post is supported entirely by the people who use it. In the future, readers who find value in the app will have the option to support its continued development through voluntary donations—but the app will remain usable and respectful whether or not you choose to contribute.

Kingdom Post isn't trying to win your attention. It's trying to earn your trust.

**Perspective without noise.**
